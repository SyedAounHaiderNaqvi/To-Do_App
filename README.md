## Purpose
To-Do is an open-source task management app written in C# and XAML and released as a UWP app. It retains some of the nostalgic Microsoft To-Do UI, but has a delightful visual overhaul for both Windows 10 and 11 users, providing a plethora of themes and options to tweak your experience.

Right now, the repo owner is the caracal who is actively improving the app, and there's still lots of stuff to finish. Therefore I always welcome new issues and discussions related to the app.

## Installation
### For normal users
- Search the Microsoft Store for To-Do by FireCubeStudios (thanks to [@FireCubeStudios](https://github.com/FireCubeStudios) for hosting this app on their account).
- Download and install the app (NOTE: Store version might be older than GitHub one. If so, use the below method).
### For advanced users
- Go to the Releases view, and download the zip file of the latest stable (recommended) or pre-release version.
- Unzip the downloaded file, and run the msixbundle file to install it.

## Roadmap
- [ ] \(Pre-release) Complete the dynamic page content algorithm
- [ ] \(Pre-release) Fix backup algorithm
- [ ] \(Pre-release) Polish the loading experience for pages
- [ ] Reduce unnecessary modules and XAML controls
- [ ] Add comments to code for ease of understanding
